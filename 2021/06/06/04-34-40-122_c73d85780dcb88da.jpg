It is now closer to $12 billion and the deal is expected to be announced as early as next week, said multiple sources who have asked not to be identified because they&#8217;re not authorized to discuss the deal. Aurora declined to comment. Reinvent also declined to comment.<\/p>\n<p>The Hoffman, Pincus, Thompson trio, who are bullish on a concept that they call &#8220;venture capital at scale,&#8221; have formed three SPACs, or blank-check companies. Two of those SPACs have announced mergers with private companies. Reinvent Technology Partners announced a deal in February to merge with the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/24\/joby-aviation-takes-flight-into-the-public-markets-via-a-spac-merger\/\">electric vertical take off and landing company Joby Aviation<\/a>, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Reinvent Technology Partners Z merged with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210304005356\/en\/Hippo-to-Go-Public-in-Merger-w[%E2%80%A6]ners-Z-Company-is-Transforming-the-Home-Insurance-Industry\">home insurance startup Hippo<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Their latest SPAC, known as Reinvent Technology Partners Y,\u00a0 priced its initial public offering of 85 million units at $10 per unit to raise $850 million. The SPAC issued an additional 12.7 million shares to cover over allotments with total gross proceeds of $977 million, according to regulatory filings. The units are listed on the Nasdaq exchange and trade under the ticker symbol &#8220;RTPYU.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Aurora already has a relationship with Hoffman. In February 2018, Aurora raised $90 million from Greylock Partners and Index Ventures. Hoffman, who is a partner at Greylock, and Index Ventures&#8217; Mike Volpi became board members of Aurora as part of the Series A round. The following year, Aurora raised more than $530 million in a Series B round led by Sequoia Capital and included Amazon and T. Rowe Price Associates. Lightspeed Venture Partners, Geodesic, Shell Ventures and Reinvent Capital also participated in the round, as well as previous investors Greylock and Index Ventures.<\/p>\n<p>While Hoffman and Reinvent showing up on two sides of a SPAC deal would be unusual, it is not unprecedented. For instance, a blank-check company formed by T.J. Rodgers announced in February a merger with Enovix, a battery technology company that he has been a director of since 2012 and is its largest shareholder, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-02-23\/former-cypress-ceo-tj-rodgers-shows-up-on-two-sides-of-spac-deal?sref=gni836kR\">Bloomberg reported at the time<\/a>. In this case, Hoffman is a board member, but not its largest shareholder.<\/p>\n<p>Aurora, which was founded in 2017 by Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell and Chris Urmson, has had a high-flying year. In December, the company reached an agreement with Uber to buy the ride-hailing firm&#8217;s self-driving unit in a complex deal that valued the combined company at $10 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Aurora did not pay cash for Uber ATG, a company that was valued at $7.25 billion following a $1 billion investment in 2019 from Toyota, DENSO and SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora. The deal gave Uber a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (As a refresher, Uber held an 86.2% stake (on a fully diluted basis) in Uber ATG, according to filings with the SEC. Uber ATG&#8217;s investors held a combined stake of 13.8% in the company.)<\/p>\n<p>Since the acquisition, Aurora has spent the past several months integrating Uber ATG employees and now has a workforce of about 1,600 people. Aurora more recently said it reached an agreement with Volvo to jointly develop autonomous semi-trucks for North America. That partnership, which is expected to last several years and is through Volvo&#8217;s Autonomous Solutions unit, will focus on developing and deploying trucks built to operate autonomously on highways between hubs for Volvo customers.<\/p>\n<p>In March, Aurora <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1852011\/000185201121000001\/xslFormDX01\/primary_doc.xml\">disclosed in a regulatory filing<\/a>, that it has sold $54.9 million in an equity offering that kicked off in March 2021.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cRaI2GSkbX\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/19\/arrivals-denis-sverdlov-on-the-new-era-of-car-manufacturing\/\">Arrival&#8217;s Denis Sverdlov on the new era of car manufacturing<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Arrival&#8217;s Denis Sverdlov on the new era of car manufacturing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/19\/arrivals-denis-sverdlov-on-the-new-era-of-car-manufacturing\/embed\/#?secret=cRaI2GSkbX\" data-secret=\"cRaI2GSkbX\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Autonomous vehicle startup Aurora is close to finalizing a deal to merge with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the newest special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson, according to several sources familiar with the talks.

Why? The fragmented approach we\u2019re currently using in the security operations center (SOC) does not work.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick refresher on security operations and how we got where we are today: A decade ago, we protected our applications and websites by monitoring event logs \u2014 digital records of every activity that occurred in our cyber environment, ranging from logins to emails to configuration changes. Logs were audited, flags were raised, suspicious activities were investigated, and data was stored for compliance purposes.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe security-driven data stored in a data lake can be in its native format, structured or unstructured, and therefore dimensional, dynamic and heterogeneous, which gives data lakes their distinction and advantage over data warehouses.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>As malicious actors and adversaries became more active, and their tactics, techniques and procedures (or TTP\u2019s, in security parlance) grew more sophisticated, simple logging evolved into an approach called \u201csecurity information and event management\u201d (SIEM), which involves using software to provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. SIEM software uses rule-driven correlation and analytics to turn raw event data into potentially valuable intelligence.<\/p>\n<p>Although it was no magic bullet (it\u2019s challenging to implement and make everything work properly), the ability to find the so-called \u201cneedle in the haystack\u201d and identify attacks in progress was a huge step forward.<\/p>\n<p>Today, SIEMs still exist, and the market is largely led by Splunk and IBM QRadar. Of course, the technology has advanced significantly because new use cases emerge constantly. Many companies have finally moved into cloud-native deployments and are leveraging machine learning and sophisticated behavioral analytics. However, new enterprise SIEM deployments are fewer, costs are greater, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the overall needs of the CISO and the hard-working team in the SOC have changed.<\/p>\n<h2>New security demands are asking too much of SIEM<\/h2>\n<p><strong>First, data has exploded<\/strong> <strong>and SIEM is too narrowly focused.<\/strong> The mere collection of security events is no longer sufficient because the aperture on this dataset is too narrow. While there is likely a massive amount of event data to capture and process from your events, you are missing out on vast amounts of additional information such as OSINT (open-source intelligence information), consumable external-threat feeds, and valuable information such as malware and IP reputation databases, as well as reports from dark web activity. There are endless sources of intelligence, far too many for the dated architecture of a SIEM.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Additionally, data exploded alongside costs. <\/strong>Data explosion + hardware + license costs = spiraling total cost of ownership. With so much infrastructure, both physical and virtual, the amount of information being captured has exploded. Machine-generated data has grown at 50x, while the average security budget grows 14% year on year.<\/p>\n<p>The cost to store all of this information makes the SIEM cost-prohibitive. The average cost of a SIEM has skyrocketed to close to<a href=\"https:\/\/foresite.com\/true-cost-siem-security-information-event-management\/\"> $1 million annually<\/a>, which is only for license and hardware costs. The economics force teams in the SOC to capture and\/or retain less information in an attempt to keep costs in check. This causes the effectiveness of the SIEM to become even further reduced. I recently spoke with a SOC team who wanted to query large datasets searching for evidence of fraud, but doing so in Splunk was cost-prohibitive and a slow, arduous process, leading the team to explore alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>The shortcomings of the SIEM approach today are dangerous and terrifying. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190730005215\/en\/Ponemon-Study-53-Percent-of-IT-Security-Leaders-Don%E2%80%99t-Know-if-Cybersecurity-Tools-are-Working-Despite-an-Average-of-18.4-Million-Annual-Spend\"> A recent survey by the Ponemon Institute<\/a> surveyed almost 600 IT security leaders and found that, despite spending an average of $18.4 million annually and using an average of 47 products, a whopping 53% of IT security leaders \u201cdid not know if their products were even working.\u201d It\u2019s clearly time for change.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The average corporate security organization is largely ineffective at preventing breaches, IP theft and data loss.

href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/tinder-bumble-and-hinge-show-surge-in-americans-looking-for-love-online-11613246400\">a recent spike<\/a> in both downloads and usage. Now, as COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available, it&#8217;s likely that this trend will continue.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, Tinder is anticipating a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tinderpressroom.com\/2021-06-04-Tinder-Gives-Members-More-Control-With-New-Feature-Allowing-You-to-Block-Your-Ex\">post-pandemic uncuffing season<\/a>,&#8221; and they&#8217;re rolling out a new feature to prepare. Now, users can upload their phone contacts to select certain people that they&#8217;d rather not see on the app, whether that&#8217;s an ex, a co-worker or a family member. According to a survey commissioned by Tinder, 40% of people have found an ex-partner on the app, 24% have encountered a family member and one in 10 have even encountered their professor.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, it would be pretty awkward to see your ex out on the dating market again. But the new feature is more interesting for the user safety aspect. For example, if someone has previously encountered a stalker or otherwise abusive figure &#8212; whether on the app or off &#8212; they now have a tool to directly block them on Tinder.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>However, instead of creating a simple form where you could enter the phone number or email address of the abuser, Tinder is asking for permission to access the user&#8217;s entire contacts list. Ostensibly, this is for ease of use &#8212; Tinder even claims it only keeps on hand the contact information for those you&#8217;ve blocked, and not your entire address book &#8212; but users may still be wary. For years, social apps have used address book uploads as a big data grab from users, with little benefit beyond friend-finding functionality. More recently, this trend has reemerged with new apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store\/\">Poparazzi<\/a> and Clubhouse. The latter thankfully<a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/recode\/22332182\/clubhouse-privacy-contacts-invites-update\"> stopped<\/a> the practice in March after user outcry.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1FOkTcBkSf\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store\/\">Poparazzi hypes itself to the top of the App Store<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Poparazzi hypes itself to the top of the App Store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store\/embed\/#?secret=1FOkTcBkSf\" data-secret=\"1FOkTcBkSf\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re rolling out Block Contacts as an additional resource empowering members with peace of mind by helping create a worry-free space for them to spark new connections,&#8221; said Bernadette Morgan, Group Product Manager, Trust &amp; Safety at Tinder, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tinderpressroom.com\/2021-06-04-Tinder-Gives-Members-More-Control-With-New-Feature-Allowing-You-to-Block-Your-Ex\">statement<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Tinder tested the Block Contacts feature in India, Korea and Japan, reporting that members who used the feature blocked about a dozen people on average.<\/p>\n<p>To use the feature, go to Settings under your profile icon, select &#8220;Block Contacts,&#8221; then grant the app permission. To block individuals, you can&#8217;t rely on whether or not they were blocked on your phone. You&#8217;ll need to select each person you want to block under the &#8220;Contacts&#8221; tab then tap &#8220;Block Contacts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This user interface makes it easier to block abusers and exes, but it&#8217;s also designed for people who want to block a large number of people &#8212; like everyone in their family or close friend group. That makes the feature a big perk for those using Tinder&#8217;s app to cheat, too.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Tinder is strict about requiring a valid phone number to register, though it&#8217;s not impossible for people to circumvent the system by registering with a Google Voice number, for example.

suspends Twitter operations, says platform &#8216;undermines its corporate existence&#8217;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Through its Ministry of Information and Culture today, the Nigerian government announced its decision to suspend the operations of social media platform Twitter in the country.<\/p>\n<p>The statement, made by Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, and signed off by his media aide Segun Adeyemi, could see telecoms in the country prevent Nigerians from using Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the statement issued by the ministry:<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<blockquote><p>The Federal Government has suspended indefinitely the operations of the microblogging and social networking service Twitter in Nigeria. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, citing the presistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria&#8217;s corporate existence.<\/p>\n<p>The Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Today&#8217;s announcement is a culmination of events that have happened this past week. Yesterday, Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-57336571\">deleted tweets and videos<\/a> of President Muhammadu Buhari making threats of punishment to a sect called IPOB in the South-Eastern part of the country after he blamed them for attacks on government buildings. He then referenced Nigeria&#8217;s civil war events in the 1960s, which seemed to offend many Nigerians.<\/p>\n<p>Buhari, who was the country&#8217;s Head of State in the 1980s and served in the army against secessionists, said young Nigerians in the country&#8217;s southeastern part were too young to remember the horrible events that occurred during the war. According to him, the activities of the present-day secessionists are likely headed toward war; hence, it was proactive to stop them beforehand with force.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter chose to delete the tweet after violating its abusive behaviour policy and several calls by Nigerians to take it down. Twitter also suspended the president&#8217;s account, leaving it in a &#8220;read-only mode&#8221; for 12 hours.<\/p>\n<p>Following its decision, Mr Mohammed <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/channelstv\/status\/1400112861549051905?s=08\">called out<\/a> the social media giant by saying its decision was biased and said the president had a right to express his thoughts on events that affect the country. He also raised suspicion about the platform&#8217;s intention in the country. &#8220;Twitter may have its own rules; it&#8217;s not the universal rule. If Mr President anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views&#8230; The mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very, very suspect,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>In a retaliation act, Nigeria has proceeded to suspend the platform&#8217;s operations in the country. While Twitter doesn&#8217;t have any offices in the country, this announcement can still play out. And although there hasn&#8217;t been any social media ban yet, Nigeria&#8217;s current administration is no stranger to making ploys to restrict access to the internet, certain websites or social media. It was one of the tactics used during <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/End_SARS\">the EndSARS protests<\/a> that rocked the country in October 2020. Given past events in other African countries where the internet has been restricted or banned in one form or another, this is an obvious ploy by the Nigerian government to double down on these tactics and use telecoms operators to repress free speech.<\/p>\n<p>In an email to TechCrunch, Twitter, which recently opened its first African office in Ghana, said, &#8220;the announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter&#8217;s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning. We&#8217;re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Subsequently, the microblogging platform via its public policy account tweeted:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria.

WWDC last year. Where other companies like Microsoft and Google have opted for a more live (or live-style) experience, the company was parading its execs through a series of smooth drone shots and slick transitions. And with the first year under its belt, it will be fun to see how the company outdoes itself.<\/p>\n<p>As far as news goes, the WWDC keynote kickoff is always packed &#8212; and this year is no different. In fact, there\u2019s a good chance that we could see even more. In addition to the standard developer-focused updates to iOS\/iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS and the like, we could well see some new hardware dropping at the event.<\/p>\n<p>As ever, we\u2019ll be breaking the news live, and this time out, we\u2019re bringing back the liveblog. So, you know, lots of different ways to follow along live. The event kicks off at 10AM PT\/1PM ET on Monday, June 7.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"elBSLeeqE6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/24\/apples-first-virtual-wwdc-keynote-set-a-new-standard-for-remote-presentations\/\">Apple\u2019s first virtual WWDC keynote set a new standard for remote presentations<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple\u2019s first virtual WWDC keynote set a new standard for remote presentations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/24\/apples-first-virtual-wwdc-keynote-set-a-new-standard-for-remote-presentations\/embed\/#?secret=elBSLeeqE6\" data-secret=\"elBSLeeqE6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Speaking of, you can also check out the YouTube livestream here:<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0TD96VTf0Xs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As usual, iOS is the tentpole attraction here &#8212; if nothing else, because Apple sells more iPhones than anything else.

This week, I&#8217;m talking about the search for a new crypto messiah.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox from the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\"><span class=\"s1\">newsletter page<\/span><\/a>, and follow my tweets <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lucasmtny\"><span class=\"s1\">@lucasmtny<\/span><\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><strong>The Big Thing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Elon has worn out his welcome among the crypto illuminati, and the acolytes of Bitcoin are searching out a new emperor god king.<\/p>\n<p>This weekend, thousands of crypto acolytes and investors have descended on a Bitcoin-themed conference in Miami, a very real, very heavily-produced conference sporting crypto celebrities and actual celebrities all on a mission to make waves.<\/p>\n<p>Even though I am not at the conference in person (panels from its main stage were live-streamed online), I have plenty of invites in my email for afterparties featuring celebrities, open bars and endless conversations on the perils of fiat. The cryptocurrency community has never been larger or richer thanks to its most fervent bull run yet, and despite a pretty noteworthy correction in the past few weeks, people believe the best is yet to come.<\/p>\n<p>Despite having so much, what they still seem to be lacking is a patron saint.<\/p>\n<p>For the longest bout, that was SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk who bolstered the currency by pushing Tesla to invest cash on its balance sheet into bitcoin, while also pushing for Tesla to accept bitcoin payments for its vehicles. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/16\/elon-musk-giveth-and-taketh-away\/\">As I&#8217;ve noted in this newsletter in the past<\/a>, Musk had a tough time reconciling the sheer energy use of bitcoin&#8217;s global network with his eco warrior bravado which has seemed to lead to his mild and uneven excommunication (though I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s welcome back at any time).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Goods &amp; services are the real economy, any form of money is simply the accounting thereof<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1401251430015582209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>There are plenty of celebrities looking to fill his shoes &#8212; a<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u00a0recent <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/cRHIf2QVU1?amp=1\">endorsement gone wrong<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> by Soulja Boy was one of the more comical instances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Crypto has been no stranger to grift &#8212; of that even the most hardcore crypto grifters can likely agree &#8212; and I think there&#8217;s been some agreement that the only leader who can truly preach the gospel is someone who is already so rich they don&#8217;t even need more money. It&#8217;s one reason the community has offered up so much respect for Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin who truly doesn&#8217;t seem to care too much about getting any wealthier &#8212;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/12\/vitalik-buterin-donates-1-billion-worth-of-meme-coins-to-india-covid-relief-fund\/\"> he donated about $1 billion worth of crypto to Covid relief efforts in India.<\/a> A Musk-like cheerleader serves a different purpose though, and so the community is in search of a Good Billionaire.<\/p>\n<p>The best runner-up at the moment appears to be one Jack Dorsey, and while &#8212; like Musk &#8212; he is also another double-CEO, he is quite a bit different from him in demeanor and desire for the spotlight. He was, however, a headline speaker at Miami&#8217;s Bitcoin conference.<\/p>\n<p>Dorsey gathers the most headlines for his work at Twitter but it&#8217;s Square where he is pushing most of his crypto enthusiasm. Users can already use Square&#8217;s Cash App to buy Bitcoin. Minutes before going onstage Friday, Dorsey tweeted out a thread detailing that Square was interested in building its own hardware wallet that users could store cryptocurrency like bitcoin on outside of the confines of an exchange.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Square is considering making a hardware wallet for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bitcoin<\/a>. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community. We want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; jack (@jack) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jack\/status\/1400839179513339905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 4, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>\u201cBitcoin changes absolutely everything,\u201d Dorsey said onstage. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything more important in my lifetime to work on.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And while the billionaire Dorsey seems like a good choice on paper &#8212; he tweets about bitcoin often, but only <em>good<\/em> tweets.

thrifty marketplace for resale goods,<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/02\/etsy-is-acquiring-social-selling-site-depop-for-1-625b-in-a-mostly-cash-deal\/\"> for $1.625 billion this week.<\/a> So, today we\u2019ll discuss the tale of two marketplaces, a deal that has given us a peek into the evolving ethos of social shopping.<\/p>\n<p>Depop, for those that don\u2019t know, is a London-based company that targets millennial and Gen Z shoppers. Within the past two years, Depop has grown its user base of stylists, designers, artists, vintage sellers and more, from 13 million to 21 million, And, the company claims, some 90% of its users are under the age of 26.<\/p>\n<p>With the buy, Etsy is growth hacking its way into a younger generation, one that thinks thrifting is trendy and individualism is more interesting than fast fashion. But to me, combining two, two-sided marketplaces is not where the work stops. Etsy, with Depop under its umbrella, has an opportunity to be far more inventive with the way it combines operations.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/02\/etsy-is-acquiring-social-selling-site-depop-for-1-625b-in-a-mostly-cash-deal\/\">Etsy is acquiring UK-based social selling site Depop for $1.625B in a mostly cash deal<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/02\/etsy-asks-how-do-you-do-fellow-kids-with-1-6b-depop-purchase\/\">Etsy asks \u2018How do you do, fellow kids?\u2019 with a $1.6B Depop purchase<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>First, Etsy needs to find other ways \u2014 beyond a new volume of fresh goods \u2014 to modernize its user experience, from homepage to checkout. Why? Because, and I can say this because I am technically part of the cohort, Gen Z is impatient. Sure, thrifting is trendy \u2014 but so is Amazon. The same generation that loves the idea of sporting the individual creative, also loves the idea of low-cost goods and two-day shipping. Sure, there are people that sit at either extreme. But I\u2019d bet an unnecessary milk frother that the majority of Gen Z consumers sit in a more grey space.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, Etsy and Depop have an opportunity to invest in the growing wave of social shopping experiences. When I saw this news break, I immediately thought of The Landing, a company that is using <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/25\/the-landing-is-bringing-shoppable-social-and-collaboration-to-interior-design\/\">customizable and collaborative mood boards<\/a> as a shopping tool. The startup allows users to create mood boards from products that they can then shop from. Right now, it\u2019s starting with interior design, but the vision can easily extend beyond home goods into clothing or CPG products. Similar to Pinterest, The Landing is trying to serve a set of consumers that like shopping in a collaborative, scroll-friendly way. I\u2019m not asking Etsy to go full early-stage startup, but it would certainly be compelling if it found new ways for consumers to experience its broadened marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll stop there, and end with this: As more and more companies prioritize serving Gen Z, strategy needs to be more than a land grab. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_johnsonator\/status\/1400117894248341504\">As one person put it<\/a>, Etsy is \u201censuring the brand translates through different generational ethos,\u201d with the acquisition. I\u2019m excited to watch this case study in the making play out.<\/p>\n<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we\u2019ll discuss digital health, the beautiful world of S-1 filings and a Medium memo that has caused employees to leave the company.

In April, Medium CEO Ev Williams wrote a memo about the company\u2019s culture. Several employees argue the undertone of the memo has paved the way for an unsafe, \u201cnod-and-smile\u201d work environment, triggering more exits. Of the 241 people who started at Medium, some 50% of that pool are now gone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s what to know:<\/strong> Similar to Coinbase and Basecamp, Medium\u2019s culture memo has made employees leave due to a change in mission.

It\u2019s broadly based on <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/the-exchange\/\"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch<\/em><\/a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. <\/em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\"><em>here<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Ready? Let\u2019s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Happy Saturday everyone. Despite it being a short week I feel pretty run over from the sheer news volume that we\u2019ve put up with in the last few days. So let\u2019s pause, repine and talk about SPACs as a nice little treat.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>No, we\u2019re not going through a SPAC investor presentation teardown today. Though we will dig into the <a href=\"https:\/\/uploads-ssl.webflow.com\/6010a862416e07401f64bc95\/60b8b95610f77f32420593f8_2021.03.06%20Babylon%20Announcement%20Presentation.pdf\">Babylon Health SPAC<\/a> on Monday. Instead, we\u2019re discussing the SoFi and BarkBox blank-check deals.<\/p>\n<p>Both began to trade this week after announcing their public debuts some time ago. And things went just fine? Here\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/06\/01\/sofi-shares-rise-after-debut-on-nasdaq.html\">CNBC on SoFi\u2019s first minutes<\/a> as a public company:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>SoFi, short for Social Finance, went public by merging with Social Capital Hedosophia Corp V, a blank-check company run by venture capital investor Chamath Palihapitiya. The stock closed up more than 12% to $22.65.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That\u2019s not only a win for SoFi, but also for the somewhat-embattled Chamath Palihapitiya, whose SPAC bets have lost some luster in recent months; of course all SPAC-led debuts are speculative, but some retail traders appeared to index more on Palihapitiya\u2019s reputation than fundamentals &#8212; what can you do!<\/p>\n<p>BarkBox also did perfectly ok when it began to trade this week after its own SPAC combination was consummated, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/barkbox-stock-ipo-price-51622660797\">as Barrons reported<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>BARK stock (ticker: BARK) jumped about 7.5% on Wednesday, to trade at around $12 in the afternoon. That gives the company a market value of close to $2.4 billion.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>BarkBox stock has since given up some of its gains, but managed to get public without falling below its initial SPAC price. That\u2019s a win given how market conditions have shifted since its flotation was initially announced.<\/p>\n<p>Two wins in a single week is good news for SPAC-land and the myriad players on the blank-check and startup sides of the marketplace. Naturally two solid results does not a trend make, but it seems clear that for companies with material revenues the SPAC-route is not as potholed as we might have expected.<\/p>\n<h2>The crypto wager<\/h2>\n<p>If you think SPACs are generally annoying, just wait until we fuse the blank-check boom with crypto. As we are about to do!<\/p>\n<p>This week Circle, a crypto-focused company with a particular taste for stablecoins, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freightwaves.com\/news\/circle-raises-440-million-eyes-possible-spac\">raised $440 million<\/a>. That was an ocean of capital for a company best known for the USDC stablecoin; it is also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/106473\/after-440-million-fundraise-circle-is-said-to-be-considering-a-spac-deal\">reported to be considering a SPAC-led IPO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>What is a stablecoin? It\u2019s a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a fiat currency. In the case of USDC, as you surmised, the coin is pegged to the US dollar. Stablecoins are useful fiat comps inside the crypto world and have proven to be hugely popular.<\/p>\n<p>Circle\u2019s USDC has $22.8 billion worth of supply in circulation, it claims, and several billion in daily transactions, per CoinMarketCap data. That\u2019s not bad! But what isn\u2019t as clear to your humble servant is precisely how the firm generates huge revenues at super-attractive gross margins. Which is what we\u2019d expect from a company that just locked down nearly a half-billion dollars (or USDC, we suppose) in private capital in a single go.<\/p>\n<p>So, for once, bring on the SPAC. Because we want to see the damn numbers, and quickly, given our sheer curiosity.<\/p>\n<h2>Growth?<\/h2>\n<p>Wrapping, Ron and I got to dig into a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/28\/once-a-buzzword-digital-transformation-is-reshaping-markets\/\">public companies\u2019 earnings reports the other day<\/a>, essentially discovering that the vaunted digital transformation <em>acceleration<\/em> is actually coming true for some companies.<\/p>\n<p>This week\u2019s news continued the argument. Zoom\u2019s earnings, for example, backed up our thesis. Its revenues <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.zoom.us\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/zoom-reports-financial-results-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2022\">were up 191%<\/a> in Q1 F2022 compared to Q1 F2021. That\u2019s just bonkers good.<\/p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum are Dropbox and Box, which are under fresh pressure this week from external investors. The pair of former private-market darlings have run into a growth wall and are taking incoming fire due to it. Grow or die is more than just startup advice. It\u2019s what software companies need to do if they want to stay in charge of their own destiny.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alex\">Alex<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574370,"featured_media":2009129,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"a6574be9-ea5f-367a-bf51-27b2d4a5df28"},"categories":[17396],"tags":[7124,576886842],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange-multicolor.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3uVtdhW","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1461024],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2161657"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2161657"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2161657\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2161669,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2161657\/revisions\/2161669"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/alex-wilhelm"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2161657&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574370"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2009129"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2161657"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2161657"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2161657"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2161657"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2161657"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2161657"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2161657"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1461024,"name":"Alex Wilhelm","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/alex-wilhelm\/","description":"Alex Wilhelm is the editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchbase.news\">Crunchbase News<\/a> and co-host of <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/equity\/id1215439780?mt=2\">Equity<\/a>, TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast.","slug":"alex-wilhelm","links":{"facebook":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alex.wilhelm","twitter":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alexwilhelm\/","homepage":"","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/alex-wilhelm"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"<p>Alex Wilhelm is Senior Editor at TechCrunch.

The livestream page is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-events\/event-stream\/index.html\">here<\/a>. While we may see new MacBook Pros, what software developers will care about are the forthcoming details about Apple&#8217;s latest OS releases and other new technologies. As to what they may include? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/technology?sref=gni836kR\">Bloomberg reported<\/a> that iOS 15 will introduce a way for users to set different notification preferences and automatic replies, based on their current status (driving, working, sleeping, etc.) and an updated Lock Screen where this menu of choices would be accessible. iMessage may be upgraded to be more social, to better compete with Messenger and WhatsApp. Meanwhile, iPadOS could be getting the App Library and an upgraded Home Screen with support for widgets. (And you can fill the screen with just widgets, if you choose.) Or who knows! Until it&#8217;s official, it&#8217;s all a maybe!<\/p>\n<p>But one potentially interesting rumor to watch for would be a new privacy feature that would show users which apps were collecting data about them. This builds on Apple&#8217;s investments in App Tracking Transparency and could make it more difficult for shady SDKs to stay in business.<\/p>\n<p>There will likely be some updates coming to other Apple&#8217;s own apps, Siri, watchOS and more. It&#8217;s going to be a packed week &#8212; stay tuned!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ahead of WWDC, Apple also updated its report (conducted on its behalf via the Analysis Group) on App Store commerce. The company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/02\/apples-app-store-facilitated-643-billion-in-commerce-up-24-from-last-year\/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29\">says the App Store facilitated $643 billion in billings and sales in 2020<\/a><\/strong>, up 24% from the $519 billion seen the year prior. It also noted that about 90% of the billings and sales facilitated by the App Store actually took place outside its walls, meaning Apple took no commission on those purchases. This is up from the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/15\/as-antitrust-investigation-looms-apple-says-its-app-store-facilitated-519b-in-commerce-in-2019\/\">85% figure reported last year<\/a>. The full report delves into other trends related to the pandemic&#8217;s impact, small and large businesses, and more. Apple initially commissioned the report to demonstrate how little business on the App Store is actually subject to App Store fees, but now it&#8217;s updated the report a year later. It&#8217;s interesting how much understanding Apple has about its App Store, especially when Tim Cook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/21\/tim-cook-plays-innocent-in-epic-v-apples-culminating-testimony\/\">claimed to know so little<\/a> about several crucial figures.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2161662\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2161662\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2161662\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-04-at-3.07.10-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-04-at-3.07.10-PM.jpg 2200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-04-at-3.07.10-PM.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-04-at-3.07.10-PM.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-04-at-3.07.10-PM.jpg?resize=768,559 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-04-at-3.07.10-PM.jpg?resize=680,495 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-04-at-3.07.10-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1118 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-04-at-3.07.10-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1491 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-04-at-3.07.10-PM.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2161662\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>Apple also this week <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/news\/?id=36dv0725\">unveiled<\/a> its 2021 Apple Design finalists.<\/strong> The awards honor apps and games that offer a combination of innovation, ingenuity and technical achievement &#8212; the latter which often means making great use of Apple technologies.

The change will roll out in late 2021 and will impact apps running on Android 12 devices initially, with an expansion to devices that support Google Play in early 2022.<\/p>\n<h3>Platforms: Huawei (!!)<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2160137\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2160137\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2160137\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-8.11.21-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-8.11.21-PM.png 2530w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-8.11.21-PM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-8.11.21-PM.png?resize=300,152 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-8.11.21-PM.png?resize=768,389 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-8.11.21-PM.png?resize=680,345 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-8.11.21-PM.png?resize=1536,778 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-8.11.21-PM.png?resize=2048,1038 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-8.11.21-PM.png?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2160137\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Wang Chenglu, president of Huawei Consumer Business Group&#8217;s software department<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>Two years after Huawei was put on a list of Chinese companies banned from doing business with U.S. organizations, it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/02\/huawei-officially-launches-android-alternative-harmonyos-for-smartphones\/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29\">launched its proprietary operating system,<\/a> HarmonyOS<\/strong>, for smartphones.

where is the SEC when it comes to SPACs and conflicts of interest?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Earlier today, TechCrunch&#8217;s Kirsten Korosec reported that the autonomous vehicle startup Aurora is close to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/04\/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac\/\">finalizing a deal<\/a> to merge with one of three blank-check companies that have been formed to date by renowned entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus and a third partner in these deals, Michael Thompson, who long managed special situation funds.<\/p>\n<p>The development is intriguing for a lot of reasons, including because Aurora\u2019s founders are big wheels in their industry (no pun intended), and having already acquired the self-driving unit of Uber in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/17\/aurora-sends-offers-to-majority-uber-atg-employees-but-not-the-rd-lab\/\">complicated arrangement<\/a>, Aurora could, as a publicly traded entity, snap up even more rivals, given it would have a more liquid currency than it does right now.<\/p>\n<p>Possible merits of the deal aside, the deal is also interesting because of Hoffman&#8217;s involvement. His venture firm, Greylock, is an investor in Aurora and has been since co-leading its Series A round in 2018, at which point Hoffman joined the board as a director. Now Hoffman\u2019s SPAC is looking to take Aurora public at what we can safely assume is a much, much higher valuation than where it was valued back then. In fact, Korosec reports that one of the sticking points in this new deal is how much the company could conceivably be worth, writing that talk involved a $20 billion valuation at one point and is now closer to $12 billion, with the deal expected to be announced as early as next week.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the first time a SPAC sponsor has pursued an existing investment as a target. In just one similar case, famed VC Chamath Palihapitiya was an<a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/clover-health\/company_financials\/investors\"> investor<\/a> in insurance company Clover through his firm Social Capital and as industry watchers will know, one of his blank-check companies merged with Clover <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-clover-health-m-a-social-capital\/clover-health-to-go-public-via-3-7-billion-deal-with-social-capital-idUSKBN26R1XB\">last year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A representative for Palihapitiya declined to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-02-23\/former-cypress-ceo-tj-rodgers-shows-up-on-two-sides-of-spac-deal\">disclose to Bloomberg<\/a> whether or not he sold the stake prior to the SPAC deal, but legally, it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. All a SPAC sponsor need do right now is write a lengthy disclosure when raising a SPAC that ultimately says, \u2018Hey, I might use the capital I\u2019m raising for this blank-check company to buy another company where I already have a financial interest, and here&#8217;s how that&#8217;s going to work.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>The question is whether such rules around potential conflicts &#8212; or lack of rules &#8212; will continue to exist indefinitely. The SEC is clearly taking a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/public-statement\/accounting-reporting-warrants-issued-spacs\">closer look<\/a> right now at SPACs, and while it offered guidance specifically around conflicts of interest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/corpfin\/disclosure-special-purpose-acquisition-companies\">last December<\/a>, saying that they make the agency a little nervous and could sponsors please disclose as much as possible to everyone involved in a deal, there\u2019s a new administration in Washington and a new agency head in SEC Chief Gary Gensler, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see more being done on this front than we\u2019ve witnessed to date.<\/p>\n<p>There perhaps should be. SPACs already have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/6eb655a2-21f5-4313-b287-964a63dd88b3\">lousy reputation<\/a> because investors lose money on the majority of them, and notwithstanding the esteem of individuals like Hoffman, these obvious conflicts of interest &#8212; let&#8217;s face it &#8212; generally smell bad.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, there\u2019s a strong argument that a SPAC sponsor who has been long involved with a target company knows better the value of that company than anyone else. That inside knowledge cuts both ways, though. The target <em>could<\/em> be an amazing company that just needs a way to go public more quickly than might be possible with a traditional IPO. Let&#8217;s assume for now that Aurora falls into this camp. But the target could also need to bailed out by SPAC sponsors who have a vested interest in the company and know its prospects may dim otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>Do most retail investors know the difference between the two?

Vision Fund, Microsoft and Honda, has secured a permit that will allow the company to shuttle passengers in its test vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.cpuc.ca.gov\/PublishedDocs\/Published\/G000\/M387\/K064\/387064893.PDF\">permit<\/a>, issued by the California Public Utilities Commission as part of its driverless pilot program, is one of several regulatory requirements autonomous vehicle companies must meet before they can deploy commercially. This permit is important \u2014 and Cruise is the first to land this particular one \u2014 but it does not allow the company to charge passengers for any rides in test AVs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In order to launch a commercial service for passengers here in the state of California, you need both the California DMV and the California PUC to issue deployment permits. Today we are honored to have been the first to receive a driverless autonomous service permit to test transporting passengers from the California PUC,&#8221; Prashanthi Raman, Cruise&#8217;s director of Government Affairs said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>There are two regulatory bodies, the CPUC and the California Department of Motor Vehicles, that dictate the testing and eventual deployment of autonomous vehicles. The California DMV regulates testing of autonomous vehicles with and without safety operators. About 55 companies have permits to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver. Driverless testing permits, in which a human operator is not behind the wheel, have become the new milestone and a required step for companies that want to launch a commercial robotaxi or delivery service in the state. AutoX, Baidu, Cruise, Nuro, Pony.ai, Waymo, WeRide and Zoox have driverless permits with the DMV.<\/p>\n<p>The final step with the DMV, which only Nuro has achieved, is a deployment permit. This permit allows Nuro to deploy at a commercial scale. Nuro&#8217;s vehicles can&#8217;t hold passengers, just cargo, which allows the company to bypass the CPUC permitting process.<\/p>\n<p>Over at the CPUC, there are &#8220;drivered&#8221; and &#8220;driverless&#8221; permits, which allow companies to give rides in their autonomous vehicles. Aurora, AutoX, Cruise, Deeproute.ai, Pony, Voyage (which was acquired by Cruise) Waymo and Zoox all have &#8220;drivered&#8221; permits. Cruise is the first to snag the driverless permit.<\/p>\n<p>Any company that wants to eventually shuttle and charge passengers for rides in their robotaxis have to secure all of these permits from the DMV and CPUC.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Issuance of this first driverless permit for the CPUC&#8217;s Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service Pilot Programs is a significant milestone. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform our transportation system and communities by solving individual mobility needs, improving roadway safety, and moving goods throughout the state sustainably and efficiently,&#8221; Commissioner Genevieve Shiroma said in statement. &#8220;The effective deployment of autonomous vehicles can also transform vehicle manufacturing, maintenance, and service business models to create new jobs and industries for the California workforce.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Last year, the CPUC<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> approved two new programs to allow permitted companies to provide and charge for shared rides in autonomous vehicles as long as they can navigate the lengthy regulatory process. The decision came after months of lobbying by the AV industry pushing the <\/span>CPUC to consider a rule change that would allow for operators to charge a fare and offer shared rides in driverless vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>The CPUC said Cruise, along with any other company that eventually participates in the pilot, must submit quarterly reports about the operation of their vehicles providing driverless AV passenger service.

Big Blue also got busy buying a gaming company and getting hit with antitrust probes in the U.K. and EU.<\/p>\n<p>On the gaming front, Facebook announced today that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/04\/facebook-buys-studio-behind-roblox-like-crayta-gaming-platform\/\">it is buying Crayta<\/a>, which TechCrunch described as a \u201da Roblox-like game creation platform.\u201d Roblox, of course, recently went public via a direct listing after seeing its fortunes rise during the COVID-19 pandemic. TechCrunch also wrote that Facebook has been buying one-off VR startups as well. So, there\u2019s something of a larger gaming push afoot at the company, perhaps. If there is any rule to Facebook\u2019s actions, it\u2019s that if it sees any other company doing a thing and making money, it has to copy it.<\/p>\n<p>To close out Big Tech for the week, Facebook is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/04\/facebooks-use-of-ad-data-triggers-antitrust-probes-in-uk-and-eu\/\">under new scrutiny by both the U.K. and the EU<\/a>, this time for its use of data from advertising customers and the folks who use its single-sign-on tool.

Now, as COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available, it&#8217;s likely that this trend will continue.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, Tinder is anticipating a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tinderpressroom.com\/2021-06-04-Tinder-Gives-Members-More-Control-With-New-Feature-Allowing-You-to-Block-Your-Ex\">post-pandemic uncuffing season<\/a>,&#8221; and they&#8217;re rolling out a new feature to prepare. Now, users can upload their phone contacts to select certain people that they&#8217;d rather not see on the app, whether that&#8217;s an ex, a co-worker or a family member. According to a survey commissioned by Tinder, 40% of people have found an ex-partner on the app, 24% have encountered a family member and one in 10 have even encountered their professor.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, it would be pretty awkward to see your ex out on the dating market again. But the new feature is more interesting for the user safety aspect. For example, if someone has previously encountered a stalker or otherwise abusive figure &#8212; whether on the app or off &#8212; they now have a tool to directly block them on Tinder.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>However, instead of creating a simple form where you could enter the phone number or email address of the abuser, Tinder is asking for permission to access the user&#8217;s entire contacts list. Ostensibly, this is for ease of use &#8212; Tinder even claims it only keeps on hand the contact information for those you&#8217;ve blocked, and not your entire address book &#8212; but users may still be wary. For years, social apps have used address book uploads as a big data grab from users, with little benefit beyond friend-finding functionality. More recently, this trend has reemerged with new apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store\/\">Poparazzi<\/a> and Clubhouse. The latter thankfully<a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/recode\/22332182\/clubhouse-privacy-contacts-invites-update\"> stopped<\/a> the practice in March after user outcry.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1FOkTcBkSf\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store\/\">Poparazzi hypes itself to the top of the App Store<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Poparazzi hypes itself to the top of the App Store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store\/embed\/#?secret=1FOkTcBkSf\" data-secret=\"1FOkTcBkSf\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re rolling out Block Contacts as an additional resource empowering members with peace of mind by helping create a worry-free space for them to spark new connections,&#8221; said Bernadette Morgan, Group Product Manager, Trust &amp; Safety at Tinder, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tinderpressroom.com\/2021-06-04-Tinder-Gives-Members-More-Control-With-New-Feature-Allowing-You-to-Block-Your-Ex\">statement<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Tinder tested the Block Contacts feature in India, Korea and Japan, reporting that members who used the feature blocked about a dozen people on average.<\/p>\n<p>To use the feature, go to Settings under your profile icon, select &#8220;Block Contacts,&#8221; then grant the app permission. To block individuals, you can&#8217;t rely on whether or not they were blocked on your phone. You&#8217;ll need to select each person you want to block under the &#8220;Contacts&#8221; tab then tap &#8220;Block Contacts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This user interface makes it easier to block abusers and exes, but it&#8217;s also designed for people who want to block a large number of people &#8212; like everyone in their family or close friend group. That makes the feature a big perk for those using Tinder&#8217;s app to cheat, too.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Tinder is strict about requiring a valid phone number to register, though it&#8217;s not impossible for people to circumvent the system by registering with a Google Voice number, for example.

Why? The fragmented approach we\u2019re currently using in the security operations center (SOC) does not work.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick refresher on security operations and how we got where we are today: A decade ago, we protected our applications and websites by monitoring event logs \u2014 digital records of every activity that occurred in our cyber environment, ranging from logins to emails to configuration changes. Logs were audited, flags were raised, suspicious activities were investigated, and data was stored for compliance purposes.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe security-driven data stored in a data lake can be in its native format, structured or unstructured, and therefore dimensional, dynamic and heterogeneous, which gives data lakes their distinction and advantage over data warehouses.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>As malicious actors and adversaries became more active, and their tactics, techniques and procedures (or TTP\u2019s, in security parlance) grew more sophisticated, simple logging evolved into an approach called \u201csecurity information and event management\u201d (SIEM), which involves using software to provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. SIEM software uses rule-driven correlation and analytics to turn raw event data into potentially valuable intelligence.<\/p>\n<p>Although it was no magic bullet (it\u2019s challenging to implement and make everything work properly), the ability to find the so-called \u201cneedle in the haystack\u201d and identify attacks in progress was a huge step forward.<\/p>\n<p>Today, SIEMs still exist, and the market is largely led by Splunk and IBM QRadar. Of course, the technology has advanced significantly because new use cases emerge constantly. Many companies have finally moved into cloud-native deployments and are leveraging machine learning and sophisticated behavioral analytics. However, new enterprise SIEM deployments are fewer, costs are greater, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the overall needs of the CISO and the hard-working team in the SOC have changed.<\/p>\n<h2>New security demands are asking too much of SIEM<\/h2>\n<p><strong>First, data has exploded<\/strong> <strong>and SIEM is too narrowly focused.<\/strong> The mere collection of security events is no longer sufficient because the aperture on this dataset is too narrow. While there is likely a massive amount of event data to capture and process from your events, you are missing out on vast amounts of additional information such as OSINT (open-source intelligence information), consumable external-threat feeds, and valuable information such as malware and IP reputation databases, as well as reports from dark web activity. There are endless sources of intelligence, far too many for the dated architecture of a SIEM.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Additionally, data exploded alongside costs. <\/strong>Data explosion + hardware + license costs = spiraling total cost of ownership. With so much infrastructure, both physical and virtual, the amount of information being captured has exploded. Machine-generated data has grown at 50x, while the average security budget grows 14% year on year.<\/p>\n<p>The cost to store all of this information makes the SIEM cost-prohibitive. The average cost of a SIEM has skyrocketed to close to<a href=\"https:\/\/foresite.com\/true-cost-siem-security-information-event-management\/\"> $1 million annually<\/a>, which is only for license and hardware costs. The economics force teams in the SOC to capture and\/or retain less information in an attempt to keep costs in check. This causes the effectiveness of the SIEM to become even further reduced.

deal to merge with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the newest special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson, according to several sources familiar with the talks.<\/p>\n<p>One of the sticking points is the targeted valuation, which had been as high as $20 billion. It is now closer to $12 billion and the deal is expected to be announced as early as next week, said multiple sources who have asked not to be identified because they&#8217;re not authorized to discuss the deal. Aurora declined to comment. Reinvent also declined to comment.<\/p>\n<p>The Hoffman, Pincus, Thompson trio, who are bullish on a concept that they call &#8220;venture capital at scale,&#8221; have formed three SPACs, or blank-check companies. Two of those SPACs have announced mergers with private companies. Reinvent Technology Partners announced a deal in February to merge with the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/24\/joby-aviation-takes-flight-into-the-public-markets-via-a-spac-merger\/\">electric vertical take off and landing company Joby Aviation<\/a>, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Reinvent Technology Partners Z merged with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210304005356\/en\/Hippo-to-Go-Public-in-Merger-w[%E2%80%A6]ners-Z-Company-is-Transforming-the-Home-Insurance-Industry\">home insurance startup Hippo<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Their latest SPAC, known as Reinvent Technology Partners Y,\u00a0 priced its initial public offering of 85 million units at $10 per unit to raise $850 million. The SPAC issued an additional 12.7 million shares to cover over allotments with total gross proceeds of $977 million, according to regulatory filings. The units are listed on the Nasdaq exchange and trade under the ticker symbol &#8220;RTPYU.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Aurora already has a relationship with Hoffman. In February 2018, Aurora raised $90 million from Greylock Partners and Index Ventures. Hoffman, who is a partner at Greylock, and Index Ventures&#8217; Mike Volpi became board members of Aurora as part of the Series A round. The following year, Aurora raised more than $530 million in a Series B round led by Sequoia Capital and included Amazon and T. Rowe Price Associates. Lightspeed Venture Partners, Geodesic, Shell Ventures and Reinvent Capital also participated in the round, as well as previous investors Greylock and Index Ventures.<\/p>\n<p>While Hoffman and Reinvent showing up on two sides of a SPAC deal would be unusual, it is not unprecedented. For instance, a blank-check company formed by T.J. Rodgers announced in February a merger with Enovix, a battery technology company that he has been a director of since 2012 and is its largest shareholder, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-02-23\/former-cypress-ceo-tj-rodgers-shows-up-on-two-sides-of-spac-deal?sref=gni836kR\">Bloomberg reported at the time<\/a>. In this case, Hoffman is a board member, but not its largest shareholder.<\/p>\n<p>Aurora, which was founded in 2017 by Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell and Chris Urmson, has had a high-flying year. In December, the company reached an agreement with Uber to buy the ride-hailing firm&#8217;s self-driving unit in a complex deal that valued the combined company at $10 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Aurora did not pay cash for Uber ATG, a company that was valued at $7.25 billion following a $1 billion investment in 2019 from Toyota, DENSO and SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora. The deal gave Uber a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (As a refresher, Uber held an 86.2% stake (on a fully diluted basis) in Uber ATG, according to filings with the SEC. Uber ATG&#8217;s investors held a combined stake of 13.8% in the company.)<\/p>\n<p>Since the acquisition, Aurora has spent the past several months integrating Uber ATG employees and now has a workforce of about 1,600 people. Aurora more recently said it reached an agreement with Volvo to jointly develop autonomous semi-trucks for North America. That partnership, which is expected to last several years and is through Volvo&#8217;s Autonomous Solutions unit, will focus on developing and deploying trucks built to operate autonomously on highways between hubs for Volvo customers.<\/p>\n<p>In March, Aurora <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1852011\/000185201121000001\/xslFormDX01\/primary_doc.xml\">disclosed in a regulatory filing<\/a>, that it has sold $54.9 million in an equity offering that kicked off in March 2021.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cRaI2GSkbX\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/19\/arrivals-denis-sverdlov-on-the-new-era-of-car-manufacturing\/\">Arrival&#8217;s Denis Sverdlov on the new era of car manufacturing<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Arrival&#8217;s Denis Sverdlov on the new era of car manufacturing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/19\/arrivals-denis-sverdlov-on-the-new-era-of-car-manufacturing\/embed\/#?secret=cRaI2GSkbX\" data-secret=\"cRaI2GSkbX\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Autonomous vehicle startup Aurora is close to finalizing a deal to merge with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the newest special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson, according to several sources familiar with the talks.

href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001657573\/000119312521181945\/d120843ds1.htm\">an S-1 form<\/a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announcing its intent to become a public company.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tGrowth aside, it\u2019s clear that Xometry is no modern software business, at least from a revenue-quality profile.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>As the global supply chain tightened during the pandemic in 2020, a company that helped find excess manufacturing capacity was likely in high demand. CEO and co-founder Randy Altschuler described his company to TechCrunch this way last September upon the announcement of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/09\/xometry-raises-75m-series-e-to-expand-custom-manufacturing-marketplace\/\">a $75 million Series E investment<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve created a marketplace using artificial intelligence to power it, and provide an e-commerce experience for buyers of custom manufacturing and for suppliers to deliver that manufacturing,&#8221; Altschuler said at the time. Xometry raised nearly $200 million while private, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/xometry\/company_financials\">per Crunchbase data<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With Xometry, companies looking to build custom parts now have the ability to do so in a digital way. Rather than working the phones or starting an email chain, they can go into the Xometery marketplace, define parameters for their project and find a qualified manufacturer who can handle the job at the best price.<\/p>\n<p>As of last September, the company had built relationships with 5,000 manufacturers around the world and had 30,000 customers using the platform.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of that funding round, perhaps it wasn&#8217;t a coincidence that the company&#8217;s lead investor was T. Rowe Price. When an institutional investor is involved in a late-stage round, it&#8217;s usually a sign that the company is ready to start thinking about an IPO. Altschuler said it was definitely something the company was considering and had brought on a CFO, too, another sign that a company is ready to take that next step.<\/p>\n<p>So what do Xometry&#8217;s financials look like as it heads to the public markets? We took a look at the S-1 to find out.<\/p>\n<h2>The numbers<\/h2>\n<p>Xometry makes money in two ways. The first comes from one part of its marketplace, with the company generating \u201csubstantially all of [its] revenue\u201d from charging &#8220;buyers on its platform.\u201d The other way that Xometry engenders top line is seller-related services, including financial work. The company notes that seller-generated revenues were just 5% of its 2020 total, though it does expect that figure to rise.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the S-1 filed by Xometry, a Maryland-based service that connects companies with manufacturers with excess production capacity around the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":428363,"featured_media":1993283,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"4dfdfa92-ba1f-3df6-bd80-336bbb50dc3e"},"categories":[449557044,60523764,20429],"tags":[576849395,576845141,576717867],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796353],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/GettyImages-1149284753.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3vWwP4A","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.37,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1461024,983141],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2161614"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2161614"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2161614\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2161680,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2161614\/revisions\/2161680"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/alex-wilhelm"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/ronjourn"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2161614&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/428363"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1993283"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2161614"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2161614"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2161614"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2161614"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2161614"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2161614"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2161614"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1461024,"name":"Alex Wilhelm","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/alex-wilhelm\/","description":"Alex Wilhelm is the editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchbase.news\">Crunchbase News<\/a> and co-host of <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/equity\/id1215439780?mt=2\">Equity<\/a>, TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast.","slug":"alex-wilhelm","links":{"facebook":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alex.wilhelm","twitter":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alexwilhelm\/","homepage":"","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/alex-wilhelm"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"<p>Alex Wilhelm is Senior Editor at TechCrunch.

There are promises of retaliation against the groups responsible, the prospect of company executives being brought in front of Congress in the coming months, and even a proposed executive order on cybersecurity that could take months to fully implement.<\/p>\n<p>But once again, amid this flurry of activity, we must ask or answer a fundamental question about the state of our cybersecurity defense: Why does this keep happening?<\/p>\n<p>I have a theory on why. In software development, there is a concept called &#8220;technical debt.&#8221; It describes the costs companies pay when they choose to build software the easy (or fast) way instead of the right way, cobbling together temporary solutions to satisfy a short-term need. Over time, as teams struggle to maintain a patchwork of poorly architectured applications, tech debt accrues in the form of lost productivity or poor customer experience.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tComplexity is the enemy of security. Some companies are forced to put together as many as 50 different security solutions from up to 10 different vendors to protect their sprawling technology estates.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Our nation\u2019s cybersecurity defenses are laboring under the burden of a similar debt. Only the scale is far greater, the stakes are higher and the interest is compounding. The true cost of this &#8220;cybersecurity debt&#8221; is difficult to quantify. Though we still do not know the exact cause of either attack, we do know beef prices will be significantly impacted and gas prices jumped 8 cents on news of the Colonial Pipeline attack, costing consumers and businesses billions. The damage done to public trust is incalculable.<\/p>\n<p>How did we get here? The public and private sectors are spending more than $4 trillion a year in the digital arms race that is our modern economy. The goal of these investments is speed and innovation. But in pursuit of these ambitions, organizations of all sizes have assembled complex, uncoordinated systems \u2014 running thousands of applications across multiple private and public clouds, drawing on data from hundreds of locations and devices.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qPjMiT7oVr\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/12\/gasbuddy-tops-the-app-store-for-the-first-time-due-to-colonial-pipeline-attack\/\">GasBuddy tops the App Store for the first time due to Colonial Pipeline attack<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;GasBuddy tops the App Store for the first time due to Colonial Pipeline attack&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/12\/gasbuddy-tops-the-app-store-for-the-first-time-due-to-colonial-pipeline-attack\/embed\/#?secret=qPjMiT7oVr\" data-secret=\"qPjMiT7oVr\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Complexity is the enemy of security. Some companies are forced to put together as many as 50 different security solutions from up to 10 different vendors to protect their sprawling technology estates \u2014 acting as a systems integrator of sorts. Every node in these fantastically complicated networks is like a door or window that might be inadvertently left open. Each represents a potential point of failure and an exponential increase in cybersecurity debt.<\/p>\n<p>We have an unprecedented opportunity and responsibility to update the architectural foundations of our digital infrastructure and pay off our cybersecurity debt. To accomplish this, two critical steps must be taken.<\/p>\n<p>First, we must embrace open standards across all critical digital infrastructure, especially the infrastructure used by private contractors to service the government. Until recently, it was thought that the only way to standardize security protocols across a complex digital estate was to rebuild it from the ground up in the cloud. But this is akin to replacing the foundations of a home while still living in it. You simply cannot lift-and-shift massive, mission-critical workloads from private data centers to the cloud.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wvKzuOuFop\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/16\/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day\/\">Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/16\/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day\/embed\/#?secret=wvKzuOuFop\" data-secret=\"wvKzuOuFop\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>There is another way: Open, hybrid cloud architectures can connect and standardize security across any kind of infrastructure, from private data centers to public clouds, to the edges of the network. This unifies the security workflow and increases the visibility of threats across the entire network (including the third- and fourth-party networks where data flows) and orchestrates the response. It essentially eliminates weak links without having to move data or applications \u2014 a design point that should be embraced across the public and private sectors.<\/p>\n<p>The second step is to close the remaining loopholes in the data security supply chain. President Biden\u2019s executive order requires federal agencies to encrypt data that is being stored or transmitted. We have an opportunity to take that a step further and also address data that is in use. As more organizations outsource the storage and processing of their data to cloud providers, expecting real-time data analytics in return, this represents an area of vulnerability.<\/p>\n<p>Many believe this vulnerability is simply the price we pay for outsourcing digital infrastructure to another company. But this is not true. Cloud providers can, and do, protect their customers\u2019 data with the same ferocity as they protect their own. They do not need access to the data they store on their servers. Ever.<\/p>\n<p>To ensure this requires confidential computing, which encrypts data at rest, in transit and in process. Confidential computing makes it technically impossible for anyone without the encryption key to access the data, not even your cloud provider. At IBM, for example, our customers run workloads in the IBM Cloud with full privacy and control. They are the only ones that hold the key. We could not access their data even if compelled by a court order or ransom request. It is simply not an option.<\/p>\n<p>Paying down the principal on any kind of debt can be daunting, as anyone with a mortgage or student loan can attest. But this is not a low-interest loan. As the JBS and Colonial Pipeline attacks clearly demonstrate, the cost of not addressing our cybersecurity debt spans far beyond monetary damages. Our food and fuel supplies are at risk, and entire economies can be disrupted.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that with the right measures \u2014 strong public and private collaboration \u2014 we have an opportunity to construct a future that brings forward the combined power of security and technological advancement built on trust.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8PvOt3AhqQ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/13\/why-blaming-the-intern-wont-save-startups-from-cybersecurity-liability\/\">Why &#8216;blaming the intern&#8217; won&#8217;t save startups from cybersecurity liability<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why &#8216;blaming the intern&#8217; won&#8217;t save startups from cybersecurity liability&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/13\/why-blaming-the-intern-wont-save-startups-from-cybersecurity-liability\/embed\/#?secret=8PvOt3AhqQ\" data-secret=\"8PvOt3AhqQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In software development, there is a concept called &#8220;technical debt.&#8221; It describes the costs companies pay when they choose to build software the easy (or fast) way instead of the right way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574447,"featured_media":2161530,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"5b6be0ef-2f1e-311c-a36e-e97072c51299"},"categories":[25515,14911,352,21587494,17396],"tags":[1715866,576666023,15472048,576881930,965824,1188524,5564,6474,2301],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-494521219.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3uRE2Sc","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2126539],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2161491"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2161491"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2161491\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2161613,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2161491\/revisions\/2161613"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/howard-boville"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2161491&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574447"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2161530"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2161491"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2161491"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2161491"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2161491"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2161491"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2161491"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2161491"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2126539,"name":"Howard Boville","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/howard-boville\/","description":"Howard Boville is head of IBM Hybrid Cloud.

interface teamed with discovery and community features. Crayta has cornered its own niche pushing monetization paths like Battle Pass seasons, giving the platform a more Fortnite-like vibe as well.<\/p>\n<p>Unit 2 has been around for just over three years, and Crayta launched just last July.

will reconsider Trump&#8217;s ban in two years"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The clock is ticking on former President Donald Trump&#8217;s ban from Facebook, formerly indefinite and now for a period of two years, the maximum penalty under a newly revealed set of rules for suspending public figures. But when the time comes, the company will reevaluate the ban and make a decision then whether to end or extend it, rendering it indefinitely definite.<\/p>\n<p>The ban of Trump in January was controversial in different ways to different groups, but the issue on which Facebook&#8217;s Oversight Board stuck as it chewed over the decision was that there was nothing in the company&#8217;s rules that supported an indefinite ban. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/05\/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board\/\">Either remove him permanently, they said, or else put a definite limit to the suspension<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook has chosen&#8230; neither, really. The two-year limit on the ban (backdated to January) is largely decorative, since the option to extend it is entirely Facebook&#8217;s prerogative, as VP of public affairs Nick Clegg writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>At the end of this period, we will look to experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded. We will evaluate external factors, including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest. If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded.<\/p>\n<p>When the suspension is eventually lifted, there will be a strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions that will be triggered if Mr. Trump commits further violations in future, up to and including permanent removal of his pages and accounts.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It <em>sort of<\/em> fulfills the recommendation of the Oversight Board, but truthfully Trump&#8217;s position is no less precarious than before. A ban that can be rescinded or extended whenever the company chooses is certainly &#8220;indefinite.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"RNBIhRHLwZ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/05\/facebooks-hand-picked-oversight-panel-upholds-trump-ban-for-now\/\">Facebook&#8217;s hand-picked &#8216;oversight&#8217; panel upholds Trump ban &#8212; for now<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s hand-picked &#8216;oversight&#8217; panel upholds Trump ban &#8212; for now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/05\/facebooks-hand-picked-oversight-panel-upholds-trump-ban-for-now\/embed\/#?secret=RNBIhRHLwZ\" data-secret=\"RNBIhRHLwZ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DaveLeeFT\/status\/1400880616032276480\">statement<\/a>, Trump called the ruling &#8220;an insult.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That said, the Facebook decision here does reach beyond the Trump situation.

Will they be deliberated publicly?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that we must assume Facebook will be inconsistent or self-deal or make bad decisions on any of these questions and the many more that come to mind, exactly (though that is a real risk), but that this neither adds nor exposes any machinery of the Facebook moderation process during moments of crisis when we most need to see it working.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the new official-looking punishment gradient and re-re-reiterated promise to be transparent, everything involved in what Facebook proposes seems just as obscure and arbitrary as the decision that led to Trump&#8217;s ban.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We know that any penalty we apply \u2014 or choose not to apply \u2014 will be controversial,&#8221; writes Clegg. True, but while some people will be happy with some decisions and others angry, all are united in their desire to have the processes that lead to said penalties elucidated and adhered to.

The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, citing the presistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria&#8217;s corporate existence.<\/p>\n<p>The Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Today&#8217;s announcement is a culmination of events that have happened this past week. Yesterday, Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-57336571\">deleted tweets and videos<\/a> of President Muhammadu Buhari making threats of punishment to a sect called IPOB in the South-Eastern part of the country after he blamed them for attacks on government buildings. He then referenced Nigeria&#8217;s civil war events in the 1960s, which seemed to offend many Nigerians.<\/p>\n<p>Buhari, who was the country&#8217;s Head of State in the 1980s and served in the army against secessionists, said young Nigerians in the country&#8217;s southeastern part were too young to remember the horrible events that occurred during the war. According to him, the activities of the present-day secessionists are likely headed toward war; hence, it was proactive to stop them beforehand with force.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter chose to delete the tweet after violating its abusive behaviour policy and several calls by Nigerians to take it down. Twitter also suspended the president&#8217;s account, leaving it in a &#8220;read-only mode&#8221; for 12 hours.<\/p>\n<p>Following its decision, Mr Mohammed <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/channelstv\/status\/1400112861549051905?s=08\">called out<\/a> the social media giant by saying its decision was biased and said the president had a right to express his thoughts on events that affect the country. He also raised suspicion about the platform&#8217;s intention in the country. &#8220;Twitter may have its own rules; it&#8217;s not the universal rule. If Mr President anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views&#8230; The mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very, very suspect,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>In a retaliation act, Nigeria has proceeded to suspend the platform&#8217;s operations in the country. While Twitter doesn&#8217;t have any offices in the country, this announcement can still play out. And although there hasn&#8217;t been any social media ban yet, Nigeria&#8217;s current administration is no stranger to making ploys to restrict access to the internet, certain websites or social media. It was one of the tactics used during <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/End_SARS\">the EndSARS protests<\/a> that rocked the country in October 2020. Given past events in other African countries where the internet has been restricted or banned in one form or another, this is an obvious ploy by the Nigerian government to double down on these tactics and use telecoms operators to repress free speech.<\/p>\n<p>In an email to TechCrunch, Twitter, which recently opened its first African office in Ghana, said, &#8220;the announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter&#8217;s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning. We&#8217;re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Subsequently, the microblogging platform via its public policy account tweeted:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria.

the company has exploded, prompting investment and interest in the automotive industry, as well as the startup world.<\/p>\n<p>TezLab, a free app that&#8217;s like a Fitbit for a Tesla vehicle, is just one example of the numerous startups that have sprung up in the past few years as electric vehicles have started to make the tiniest of dents in global sales. Now, as Ford, GM, Volvo, Hyundai along with newcomers Rivian, Fisker and others launch electric vehicles into the marketplace, more startups are sure to follow.<\/p>\n<p>Ben Schippers, the co-founder and CEO of TezLab, is one of two early-stage founders who will join us at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-mobility-2021\/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=tezlab&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=tezlab&amp;display=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021<\/a> to talk about their startups and the opportunities cropping up in this emerging age of EVs. The six-person team behind TezLab was born out of HappyFunCorp, a software engineering shop that builds apps for mobile, web, wearables and Internet of Things devices for clients that include Amazon, Facebook and Twitter, as well as an array of startups.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>HFC\u2019s engineers, including Schippers, who also co-founded HFC, were attracted to Tesla\u00a0 because of its techcentric approach and one important detail: the Tesla API endpoints are accessible to outsiders. The Tesla API is technically private. But it exists, allowing the Tesla&#8217;s app to communicate with the cars to do things like read battery charge status and lock doors.

to its Emotes this month to celebrate its 10th anniversary. These new features will include Animated Emotes, Follower Emotes and a Library for Emotes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the origin of the livestreaming platform for gamers, Emotes &#8212; Twitch\u2019s version of emojis &#8212; have been a key component of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2018\/5\/14\/17335670\/twitch-emotes-meaning-list-kappa-monkas-omegalul-pepe-trihard\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitch culture<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They\u2019re micro memes, and images like Kappa, TriHard and PogChamp have come to carry meaning in the greater gaming world, even off the Twitch platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEmotes are a language that transcends countries,&#8221; said Ivan Santana, senior director of Community Product at Twitch. &#8220;Anywhere you are in the world, they mean the same thing for us.\u201d<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Amazon-owned platform regularly adds new global Emotes, which can be used on any streamer\u2019s channel. Individual creators can make custom Emotes for their own community, which paying subscribers can use across the platform. But the ability to add animated gifs as Emotes is something that the community has been asking for since Santana can remember.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019ve been at Twitch for four years, and it\u2019s something people have been asking for since before I joined,\u201d Santana told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly been a very, very long time.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Streamers who lack animation skills need not worry. While the more tech-savvy among us can upload custom gifs, Twitch will provide six templates for streamers to choose from, which can animate their existing Emotes. These animations include Shake, Rave, Roll, Spin, Slide In and Slide Out. Viewers who are sensitive to animations will be able to turn off the feature in their Chat Settings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2161236\" style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2161236\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2161236\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/twitch-emote.gif?w=310\" alt=\"\" width=\"310\" height=\"235\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2161236\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Twitch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitch is also beta testing Follower Emotes, which will be available to select Partners and Affiliates. This feature creates a fun, free incentive for viewers to hit the follow button on a channel they might be checking out for the first time. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When viewers follow a channel, they&#8217;ll be notified when the creator is streaming, which can lead to an eventual subscription. Twitch takes 50% of streamers&#8217; subscription money, creating a valuable revenue stream for the company. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Q1 of 2021, Twitch viewership hit an all-time high, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.streamlabs.com\/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492\">growing 16.5%<\/a> since the previous quarter. Twitch viewers watched 6.34 billion hours of content in Q1, making up 72.3% of the market share. That&#8217;s double the total hours watched on Twitch in Q1 of 2020. Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming earned 12.1% and 15.6% of viewership in the sector, respectively.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor a long time, creators have been asking for better ways to attract and welcome new viewers into their channel,\u201d said Santana. \u201cThe idea is generally to create a lot of excitement around that community, and more feelings ultimately of community.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creators with beta access will be able to upload up to five Emotes for their followers, but unlike Subscriber Emotes, followers won\u2019t be able to use these across other channels. There\u2019s no guarantee that Follower Emotes will be here to stay &#8212; Santana says it\u2019s a feature Twitch is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with &#8212; but if all goes well, the feature will roll out more widely later in the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VuUPSX5h1o\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/07\/twitch-ux-teardown-the-anchor-effect-and-de-risking-decisions\/\">Twitch UX teardown: The Anchor Effect and de-risking decisions<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Twitch UX teardown: The Anchor Effect and de-risking decisions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/07\/twitch-ux-teardown-the-anchor-effect-and-de-risking-decisions\/embed\/#?secret=VuUPSX5h1o\" data-secret=\"VuUPSX5h1o\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the Library function will make it easier for creators to swap Emotes in and out of subscription tiers without having to delete and reupload them each time. This builds upon <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitch.tv\/en\/2021\/01\/26\/new-easy-emote-management-all-your-emotes-one-page\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an upgrade that launched in January<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which centralized channel-specific icons into an Emotes tab on the Creator Dashboard. As usual, new Emotes have to be approved by Twitch before they\u2019re put into use. The Library will roll out soon to all Partners and Affiliates, staggered over a few months to account for an expected increase in volume of new Emotes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;As Twitch has scaled, we now have millions of communities across many different cultures across the world,&#8221; Santana said. &#8220;We can hand over more of the controls of our Emote language to our community, and let them sort of evolve in a way that we never could imagine that ultimately serves them in their unique ways.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitch teased that there\u2019s more in the works to celebrate the platform\u2019s 10th anniversary, including an official 10-Year celebration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitch announced today that it will release major updates to its Emotes this month to celebrate its 10th anniversary.

WWDC last year. Where other companies like Microsoft and Google have opted for a more live (or live-style) experience, the company was parading its execs through a series of smooth drone shots and slick transitions. And with the first year under its belt, it will be fun to see how the company outdoes itself.<\/p>\n<p>As far as news goes, the WWDC keynote kickoff is always packed &#8212; and this year is no different. In fact, there\u2019s a good chance that we could see even more. In addition to the standard developer-focused updates to iOS\/iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS and the like, we could well see some new hardware dropping at the event.<\/p>\n<p>As ever, we\u2019ll be breaking the news live, and this time out, we\u2019re bringing back the liveblog. So, you know, lots of different ways to follow along live. The event kicks off at 10AM PT\/1PM ET on Monday, June 7.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"elBSLeeqE6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/24\/apples-first-virtual-wwdc-keynote-set-a-new-standard-for-remote-presentations\/\">Apple\u2019s first virtual WWDC keynote set a new standard for remote presentations<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple\u2019s first virtual WWDC keynote set a new standard for remote presentations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/24\/apples-first-virtual-wwdc-keynote-set-a-new-standard-for-remote-presentations\/embed\/#?secret=elBSLeeqE6\" data-secret=\"elBSLeeqE6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Speaking of, you can also check out the YouTube livestream here:<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0TD96VTf0Xs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As usual, iOS is the tentpole attraction here &#8212; if nothing else, because Apple sells more iPhones than anything else.
